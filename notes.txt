##Objective
I have created a horocope generator. 
This generator will take your sign and tell you if you will have good luck or bad luck.
Good luck will put out a positive message.
Bad luck will give out a warning. 
Three messages should be displayed after the program runs. 

**Example code, pre-log:**
`Your sign is ${sign}.`
`You will have ${luck}`
`${quote}`
